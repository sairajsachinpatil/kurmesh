# KURMESH V1

KURMESH is a maritime decision-support system. It currently contains Phase 1 infrastructure and the Phase 2 application foundation: a React health dashboard, Flask API, PostGIS persistence schema, authentication/authorization primitives, audit-event creation, and human route review/approval controls. It contains no connected environmental provider, ML, routing, simulation-worker, or frontend domain workflow implementation.

## Start locally

1. Install Docker Desktop and ensure it is running.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
3. Replace `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and the matching password in `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`. Set `AUTH_SECRET` to a unique random value of at least 32 characters. The API refuses to start without it.
4. From the repository root, run:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost`. The UI requests `GET /api/v1/health` through Nginx; no browser-side API host configuration is necessary in Compose.

## Validate

```sh
docker compose config
docker compose up --build -d
curl http://localhost/api/v1/health
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100 backend worker
docker compose down
```

The API checks PostgreSQL connectivity, the installed PostGIS extension, and Redis reachability. `GET /api/v1/health/live` is dependency-free; `GET /api/v1/health/ready` returns 503 until required dependencies are ready.

## Local non-container frontend build

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build
```

## Backend tests and migrations

```sh
docker compose run --rm backend pytest
docker compose exec backend alembic current
```

The backend container applies Alembic migrations before serving traffic. The initial migration uses explicit Alembic operations and creates only KURMESH tables and indexes. Its downgrade drops only those objects; it does not remove the PostGIS extension or unrelated database objects.

Run backend checks locally from `backend/`:

```sh
pytest -q
python -m compileall app migrations
alembic upgrade --sql head
alembic downgrade --sql base
```

The clean-PostGIS integration tests run only when `KURMESH_INTEGRATION_DATABASE_URL` names a disposable database. They reset that database's `public` schema, so never point it at operational data.

## Phase 2 API foundation

All API routes are under `/api/v1`. Health routes are public. The domain API has request-scoped SQLAlchemy sessions; domain endpoints require Bearer authentication unless otherwise indicated. Account creation creates no privileged role. Roles must be assigned through an approved administrative process outside this API foundation.

Mission mutations require the mission owner or an `admin` role. Mission state changes use the explicit state graph in the API. Route approval requires an `operator` or `admin`, an existing human review, and a different reviewer and approver. Audit events are created by mutations and have no write, update, or delete API endpoints.

## Phase 3A API

Phase 3A completes the authentication, user-profile, and mission API foundation. Register with `POST /api/v1/auth/register` using `email`, a password of at least 12 characters, and `full_name`; registration assigns the non-privileged `user` role. Authenticate with `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, then supply the returned token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

`GET /api/v1/auth/me` and `GET /api/v1/users/me` return the authenticated safe user profile. A user may retrieve their own `/api/v1/users/<uuid>` profile; `admin` may retrieve other profiles. Mission CRUD remains under `/api/v1/missions`; list responses accept `page` and `page_size` (maximum 100) and include pagination metadata. A referenced vessel must exist.

Phase 3B does not implement ML, environmental providers, routing algorithms, simulation execution, or frontend domain workflows.

## Phase 3B-1 metadata APIs

Authenticated callers can persist and retrieve explicitly supplied metadata at `/api/v1/environment/sources`, `/api/v1/environment/observations`, `/api/v1/models`, `/api/v1/models/<model_id>/artifacts`, and `/api/v1/predictions`. Observation locations use `{ "longitude": ..., "latitude": ... }` and are stored as SRID 4326 points. Prediction creation records only a submitted persistence request (`PENDING`, `FAILED`, or `MODEL_UNAVAILABLE`); it never runs inference or creates outputs.

## Phase 3B-2 governed routing workflow

Mission owners or `admin` may manage submitted route candidates and operational route records at `/missions/<mission_id>/route-candidates` and `/missions/<mission_id>/routes`. Geometry is validated SRID-4326 GeoJSON `LineString` data; these endpoints never calculate a route.

Reviews (`POST /routes/<route_id>/reviews`) and approvals (`POST /routes/<route_id>/approvals`) are separate operator/admin actions. A mission owner cannot act as reviewer or approver without admin authority, an approved review is required before approval, and the reviewer cannot approve the same route. Creating or reviewing a route never approves it; only an explicit approval record may transition it to `APPROVED` or `REJECTED`.

Mission-scoped alerts are available at `/missions/<mission_id>/alerts` with acknowledgement at `/alerts/<alert_id>/acknowledgement`. Operators/admins may record explicitly supplied provenance at `/provenance`; only admins may list it. Workflow mutations create append-oriented audit events, which have no mutation endpoint.

## Environment and safety

Use `.env.example` only as a template; never commit `.env`. The provided password is deliberately a placeholder and fails Compose interpolation until replaced. Production requires a secrets manager, TLS/reverse proxy configuration, restricted CORS origins, backups, and authenticated API domains in later phases.

## Phase 4A environmental provider architecture

Phase 4A adds an architecture boundary only; it includes no real external provider, network request, environmental value, ML inference, routing calculation, or new Flask endpoint. Existing `/api/v1/environment/*` APIs remain manual metadata APIs and retain their contracts.

Future workers or services use this flow:

```
External provider -> provider adapter -> normalized observation -> validation/status/provenance -> ingestion service -> existing environment tables
```

Provider adapters live under `backend/app/environment/providers.py`. An adapter implements `EnvironmentalProviderAdapter`, declares the domains it supports (`sea_ice`, `weather`, or `ocean_conditions`), and is responsible only for its provider's authentication, request construction, and response parsing. It returns `NormalizedEnvironmentalObservation` objects; adapters must not import Flask routes, SQLAlchemy models, repository code, ML, or routing modules.

The normalized observation carries observation type, source observation time, retrieval time, optional WGS84 location, provider/product/source reference, optional checksum, status, values/units, metadata, and provenance details. The ingestion service stores only data-bearing `LIVE`, `STALE`, or `DEGRADED` observations and creates a linked append-only provenance record using the existing `environment_sources`, `environment_observations`, and `provenance_records` schema. `UNAVAILABLE` and `ERROR` outcomes intentionally contain no values and are not persisted as observations, preventing a failure diagnostic from becoming fake environmental data.

Status semantics are explicit:

- `LIVE`: provider data is available and current according to the adapter's documented freshness rule.
- `STALE`: genuine provider data is available but outside that freshness rule.
- `DEGRADED`: genuine provider data is available with a documented limitation (for example, partial coverage); the limitation belongs in provenance/metadata.
- `UNAVAILABLE`: the provider is disabled, no adapter is registered, its domain is unsupported, or it returned no data. No observation values are invented.
- `ERROR`: an adapter raised while requesting or parsing. The normalized outcome preserves a safe diagnostic code and exception type without exposing secrets; a future worker may log operational detail separately.

Configuration is opt-in and disabled by default. `KURMESH_ENVIRONMENT_PROVIDERS` lists future adapter names; each name may use `KURMESH_ENVIRONMENT_PROVIDER_<NAME>_ENABLED`, `_ENDPOINT`, `_API_KEY`, and `_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Enabled providers require an absolute HTTP(S) endpoint. Secrets belong in deployment environment/secrets management, never source control. Compose forwards the registry and default timeout; when Phase 4B introduces a named adapter, its explicitly named endpoint/credential variables must also be forwarded to the backend/worker services.

To add a provider in a later phase: implement and test its adapter against mocked provider payloads, register it in the worker/service composition root, configure its opt-in variables, define freshness/degradation rules, and invoke `EnvironmentalObservationIngestionService` inside a transaction. Do not place provider parsing in a Flask route and do not treat mock payloads as real data.

## Repository layout

- `frontend/`: React/Vite health dashboard and API health integration.
- `backend/`: Flask API, explicit Alembic migration, PostGIS models, auth foundation, dependency health probes, structured logging, and Celery configuration.
- `workers/`: reserved for task-domain modules as worker behavior grows.
- `database/`: reserved; Alembic migrations live in `backend/migrations/`.
- `ml/`, `routing/`, `data/`, `models/`: reserved; no connected providers, artifacts, or fabricated outputs exist here.
- `tests/`: cross-service and end-to-end tests added in later phases.
